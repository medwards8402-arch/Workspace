Please suggest and implement things that will help maintain this code as you (AI) work with me to make changes.  For example: refector, add tests you can inspect, and logging you can inspect.

Future work this code will need to be robust against includes:
* Form information for plants so I can journal how things happen over the year.
* A garden planner tab where the number and size of garden beds change.  The ability to prepopulate a garden given a number of selected plants.
* The ability to save and load gardens from file
* The ability to generate PDF reports of the garden for off-screen viewing.
* The ability to view and interact with the website on a smart phone size screen.
