* Please find a way to show the light level of the beds in the garden plan.
* The light level defaults are still not correct: all show high in the garden configuration for me.  I wonder if it's loading values in when it shouldn't be in the New Garden tab.
* The plant info tab isn't populating anything when I select plants -- it shows the helper text to click on a cell to view.
