In the garden planner, I'd like the ability to add beds of different dimensions.  Instead of selecting an overall number of beds and their rows/columns:
* Treat beds like tables and have the ability to add beds and remove beds.
* Allow each bed to have different configurable dimensions and weather.
* Allow the name to be editted.
