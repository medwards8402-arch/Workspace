Bug: some of the start dates and transplant dates don't make sense regarding the fall.
Bug: Plantinfo dates are different form plant pallete in comparison to bed selection.

Aaron Feedback:
* I found myself overwriting previous plants because I tried to click on them to view the details, but had something selected in the left column, maybe there is no such thing as overwriting, plants only get placed into empty spaces and you have to use the delete button to remove

Luke feedback:
* Control click to select disparate plants
* Take into account certain plants should not be planted next to each other.
* Add bed should bring up diaglo that allows inputting paramters.  Remove could be on individual plots
* One bed as the default instead of 3 and 1
