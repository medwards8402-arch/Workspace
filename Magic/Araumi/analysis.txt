ARAUMI OF THE DEAD TIDE - DECK BUILDING ANALYSIS
=================================================

PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS GATHERING
================================
Budget Constraints:
- Main Deck: $45-55 (Commander: $0.50, remaining cards: $44.50-54.50)
- Budget Deck: $23-28 (Commander: $0.50, remaining cards: $22.50-27.50)
- Exactly 100 cards in both versions

Meta Context:
- 4-player 1-hour games
- Fast-paced gameplay favoring explosive wins
- Lower interaction requirement (4-6 removal, not 8-12)
- Focus on finishing, not controlling

Differentiation:
- Must differ from existing Sygg ETB toolbox deck
- Araumi focuses on BURST ETB value (3x simultaneously)
- Sygg focuses on CHAIN ETB value (one at a time)

Power Level: 7-8/10


PHASE 2: COMMANDER ANALYSIS
============================
Araumi of the Dead Tide - 1UB
Legendary Creature - Merfolk Ninja
Cost: $0.50

Abilities:
- {T}, Exile cards from graveyard equal to target's mana value: Encore that creature
- Encore creates THREE hasty token copies that exile at end of turn

Core Mechanic - Encore Strategy:
1. Self-mill cards into graveyard
2. Tap Araumi, exile cards from GY
3. Get THREE hasty token copies of creature
4. Trigger THREE ETB effects simultaneously
5. Tokens exile at end of turn

Win Conditions:
- Gray Merchant of Asphodel: 3 copies = ~30 life drain
- Kokusho, the Evening Star: 3 copies = 15 life drain per opponent, 45 life gain
- Woe Strider: 3 copies = 9 scry, sacrifice 6 permanents
- Mulldrifter: 3 copies = draw 6 cards

Key Synergies:
- Self-mill engines (Thought Scour, Mental Note, Perpetual Timepiece)
- ETB creatures with high impact (drain, draw, removal)
- Instant-speed self-mill for encore setup
- Graveyard protection (Archaeomancer for recursion)

Vulnerabilities:
1. Graveyard hate (Rest in Peace, Bojuka Bog)
   - Mitigation: Instant-speed encore in response
   - Backup: Some non-graveyard win conditions
2. Commander removal
   - Mitigation: Lightning Greaves, Swiftfoot Boots
   - Backup: Can win without commander via reanimation
3. Board wipes
   - Mitigation: Encore at end of turn before our turn
   - Backup: Perpetual Timepiece to reload graveyard

Strategic Timing:
- Encore on end step before our turn (get extra combat)
- Encore in response to graveyard hate
- Hold up mana for instant-speed mill + encore


PHASE 3: DECK COMPOSITION THEORY
=================================
Target Distribution:
- Lands: 37 (UB color requirements, minimal color fixing needed)
- Ramp: 10 (Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, Dimir Signet, Talisman, Mind Stone, Wayfarer's Bauble, Thought Vessel, Charcoal Diamond, Fellwar Stone, Commander's Sphere)
- Card Draw: 8 (Mulldrifter, Sea Gate Oracle, Phyrexian Rager, Deep Analysis, Night's Whisper, Sign in Blood, Brainstorm, Ponder)
- Removal: 5 (4-6 range for 1-hour meta)
- Engine (Self-Mill): 12
- Synergy (ETB Creatures): 20
- Win Conditions: 4
- Protection: 3
- Unique/Fun: 4

Total: 100 cards (including commander)

Mana Curve Target:
- 1 CMC: 4-6 (self-mill cantrips)
- 2 CMC: 8-10 (ramp, interaction)
- 3 CMC: 10-12 (Araumi, more self-mill, early ETBs)
- 4 CMC: 8-10 (value ETBs)
- 5 CMC: 4-6 (win condition ETBs)
- 6+ CMC: 2-4 (high-impact encore targets)


PHASE 4: BUDGET RESEARCH
=========================
Cost Categories:
- Bulk ($0.10-0.25): Self-mill cantrips, basic ETB creatures
- Budget ($0.25-1.00): Most ramp, removal, card draw
- Mid ($1.00-3.00): Impactful ETB creatures (Gray Merchant, Mulldrifter)
- Premium ($3.00-8.00): 3-4 cards maximum (key win conditions)

Expensive Cards to AVOID:
- Cyclonic Rift ($20+)
- Rhystic Study ($30+)
- Mystic Remora ($15+)
- Phyrexian Arena ($8+)
- Toxic Deluge ($15+)

Budget Alternatives:
- Board wipes: Crux of Fate ($0.50) instead of Toxic Deluge
- Card draw: Deep Analysis ($0.15) instead of Rhystic Study
- Interaction: Reality Shift ($0.25) instead of Pongify
- Ramp: All signets/talismans are $0.50-1.00


NEXT STEPS:
===========
Phase 5: Build core strategy (engine, synergy, win conditions, protection, unique cards)
Phase 6: Select interaction package (5 removal, board wipes)
Phase 7: Complete support package (finalize draw/ramp, select lands)
Phase 8: Vulnerability analysis and mitigation strategies
Phase 9: Assemble and validate deck (count to 100, check budget, analyze curve)
Phase 10: Create documentation files
Phase 11: Critical gap analysis (orphaned combo pieces check)
Phase 12: Final review checklist
