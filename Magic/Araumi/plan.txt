ARAUMI OF THE DEAD TIDE - GAMEPLAY PLAN
========================================

DECK OVERVIEW
=============
Commander: Araumi of the Dead Tide (1UB)
Strategy: Self-mill creatures, encore them for TRIPLE ETB triggers
Power Level: 7-8/10
Budget: $49.80 main, $27.55 budget
Win Turns: 5-6 average

Core Mechanic:
Araumi's encore ability creates THREE hasty token copies of a creature from your graveyard. These tokens exile at end of turn, but trigger all ETB effects three times.

TURN-BY-TURN GAMEPLAN
======================

TURN 1 (Ideal):
- Play: Land
- Cast: Sol Ring or Wayfarer's Bauble
- Goal: Ramp for turn 2

TURN 1 (Backup):
- Play: Land
- Cast: Thought Scour (mill 2, draw 1)
- Goal: Start filling graveyard

TURN 2:
Option A (Ramp):
- Play: Land
- Cast: 2 CMC ramp (Signet, Talisman, Mind Stone)
- Goal: Hit 4+ mana turn 3 for Araumi + protection

Option B (Mill):
- Play: Land
- Cast: Drowned Secrets or Perpetual Timepiece
- Goal: Engine for consistent mill

TURN 3 (CRITICAL):
- Play: Land
- Cast: Araumi (1UB)
- Cast: Lightning Greaves or Swiftfoot Boots (if available)
- Equip Araumi immediately
- Goal: Protected commander ready to encore

TURN 4-5 (SETUP):
- Self-mill 5-10 cards into graveyard
- Priority targets for GY:
  * Gray Merchant (primary win con)
  * Mulldrifter (draw 6)
  * Archaeomancer (get back 3 spells)
  * Fleshbag Marauder (force 3 sacrifices)
- Hold up interaction if needed
- Goal: 8-15 cards in GY with key creatures

TURN 5-6 (WIN):
Main Phase or End Step:
- Tap Araumi
- Exile cards from GY = Gray Merchant's CMC (5 cards)
- Encore Gray Merchant
- Get THREE Gary copies with haste
- Each triggers: drain = devotion to black
- Total drain: ~30+ life (10 per Gary)
- Win if opponents low on life

Backup if Gary not available:
- Encore Kokusho: 3 copies = 45 life gain, 15 drain per opponent
- Encore Sidisi: tutor 3 cards, find answers/combo
- Encore Mulldrifter: draw 6 cards, find win condition

TURN 7+ (IF GAME CONTINUES):
- Encore again on end step before your turn
- Multiple encore turns to overwhelm opponents
- Archaeomancer recursion to get back key spells
- Goal: Value-grind or combo finish

MULLIGAN STRATEGY
=================
Keep if hand has:
✓ 2-3 lands + ramp
✓ 3 lands + self-mill
✓ 2 lands + Sol Ring + anything
✓ 3 lands + Araumi protection

Mulligan if hand has:
✗ 0-1 lands
✗ 5+ lands with no action
✗ No ramp and all 5+ CMC spells
✗ No self-mill and no draw

Priority in opening hand:
1. Lands (2-3)
2. Ramp (1-2 pieces)
3. Self-mill or draw
4. Protection for Araumi

CRITICAL DECISION POINTS
=========================

When to Play Araumi:
- WAIT if: No protection available and opponents have mana up
- WAIT if: Not enough self-mill setup yet
- PLAY if: Have Lightning Greaves/Swiftfoot Boots
- PLAY if: Opponents tapped out
- PLAY if: Behind on board and need value NOW

When to Encore:
INSTANT SPEED RESPONSE:
- In response to graveyard hate (Bojuka Bog, Tormod's Crypt)
- In response to board wipe (get value before wipe)
- End step before your turn (untap for combat/protection)

SORCERY SPEED:
- Your turn with removal backup
- When opponents tapped out
- When you can win immediately (Gary encore)

What to Encore First:
Priority 1 - WIN NOW:
- Gray Merchant (if devotion 10+)
- Kokusho (if opponents at 20+ life)

Priority 2 - DRAW INTO WIN:
- Mulldrifter (draw 6 cards)
- Sea Gate Oracle (scry 6, draw 3)
- Archaeomancer (get back 3 key spells)

Priority 3 - ANSWER THREATS:
- Fleshbag Marauder (3 forced sacrifices)
- Ravenous Chupacabra (destroy 3 creatures)
- Man-o'-War (bounce 3 creatures)

Priority 4 - BUILD BOARD:
- Solemn Simulacrum (ramp 3, draw 3 when they die)
- Peregrine Drake (untap 15 lands!)
- Woe Strider (scry 3, 3 sacrifice outlets)

When to Hold Up Interaction:
- Opponent announces combo
- Opponent has threatening boardstate
- You have instant-speed removal (Reality Shift, Go for the Throat)
- You're ahead and want to protect lead

When to Tap Out:
- You can win this turn (Gary encore)
- You're behind and need to catch up (Mulldrifter encore)
- Opponents tapped out (safe to extend)

MATCHUP-SPECIFIC PLANS
=======================

VS AGGRO:
- Mulligan for early interaction
- Encore Fleshbag/Plaguecrafter for board control
- Encore Gray Merchant to stabilize life total
- Don't wait to set up - encore for value turn 4-5

VS MIDRANGE:
- Race them with encore value
- Encore Mulldrifter to out-draw them
- Encore Gonti/Sidisi for card advantage
- Win with Gray Merchant before they stabilize

VS CONTROL:
- Play around counterspells (bait with ramp)
- Encore on their end step (less mana for counters)
- Encore Archaeomancer to recurse key spells
- Grind with value until they run out of answers

VS COMBO:
- Mulligan for interaction
- Encore Fleshbag to disrupt combo pieces
- Encore Sidisi to tutor answers
- Go for fast Gary win (turn 5-6)

VS GRAVEYARD STRATEGIES:
- Use Bojuka Bog proactively
- Race them (we encore faster than they reanimate)
- Encore instant-speed in response to their GY hate
- Perpetual Timepiece as backup plan

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
=========================

1. Playing Araumi without protection
   - Wait for Lightning Greaves/Swiftfoot Boots
   - Or wait until opponents tapped out

2. Self-milling win conditions
   - Don't mill Gray Merchant if you need to hardcast it
   - Keep 1-2 win cons in deck as backup

3. Encoring too early
   - Wait until you have 8-15 cards in GY
   - Better to encore once powerfully than twice weakly

4. Ignoring graveyard hate
   - Always have instant-speed encore ready
   - Perpetual Timepiece in response to exile effects

5. Not using instant-speed mill
   - Thought Scour, Mental Note = instant encore setup
   - Can mill during opponent's end step, encore on yours

6. Focusing only on Gary
   - Mulldrifter encore draws 6 = finds Gary
   - Sidisi encore tutors 3 = finds combo
   - Have multiple paths to victory

7. Tapping Araumi into removal
   - Encore at end step, not during your turn
   - Have mana for protection spell
   - Use encore when opponents tapped out

8. Not counting devotion
   - Gray Merchant needs devotion 10+ to win
   - Count permanents before encoring Gary
   - Araumi (UB) = 2 devotion, Gary (BB) = 2 devotion per copy

ADVANCED TECHNIQUES
===================

1. DOUBLE ENCORE
   - Spark Double copies Araumi
   - Now you have TWO Araumis
   - Encore twice per turn cycle
   - EXPLOSIVE value

2. LAND UNTAP LOOPS
   - Encore Peregrine Drake (untap 5 lands x3 = 15 lands)
   - Floating mana = 15+ mana available
   - Cast Archaeomancer from hand
   - Get back instant/sorcery
   - Can encore again if you have another Araumi activation

3. INSTANT-SPEED COMBO TURN
   - Opponent's end step:
     * Thought Scour (mill 2, draw)
     * Mental Note (mill 5, draw)
   - Your turn:
     * Tap Araumi, encore Gray Merchant
     * Win with 30+ drain

4. POLITICAL ENCORE
   - Encore Hostage Taker: steal 3 permanents
   - Offer to encore for player's benefit
   - "If you don't attack me, I'll encore Fleshbag to clear player X's board"

5. SACRIFICE LOOPS
   - Encore Woe Strider (3 copies + 3 goat tokens = 6 creatures)
   - Sacrifice all 6 to Altar of Dementia
   - Mill opponents 20-30 cards
   - Find more creatures to encore
   - Repeat until opponents milled out

6. RECURSION CHAINS
   - Encore Archaeomancer (get back 3 instants/sorceries)
   - Get back: Thought Scour, Mental Note, Deep Analysis
   - Cast all three (mill more, draw more)
   - Find next encore target or win condition

BUDGET DECK ADJUSTMENTS
========================

Strategy Changes:
- Commander's Plate instead of Lightning Greaves
  * Still protects Araumi, but no shroud
  * Can target Araumi with your own buffs
  
- Vindictive Vampire instead of Kokusho
  * Much weaker win condition
  * Need more creatures dying for value
  * Pair with Fleshbag/Plaguecrafter encores

- Selhoff Occultist instead of Altar of Dementia
  * Mill on death, not instant
  * Need to encore creature that dies
  * Pair with sacrifice outlets

Timing Adjustment:
- Budget deck wins turn 6-7 instead of turn 5-6
- Need extra turn to build devotion without Kokusho
- Focus more on value encores (Mulldrifter) than combo finishes

POWER LEVEL ASSESSMENT
=======================

Current Deck: 7-8/10

To reach 8-9/10:
- Add expensive staples: Rhystic Study, Mystic Remora, Cyclonic Rift
- Add fast mana: Mana Crypt, Mana Vault, Grim Monolith
- Add tutors: Demonic Tutor, Vampiric Tutor, Mystical Tutor
- Upgrade lands: Watery Grave, Underground Sea, fetchlands
- Cost increase: ~$300-500

To stay 7-8/10 (current):
- Focus on encore synergy
- Budget-efficient interaction
- Fast clock with Gray Merchant
- Minimal expensive cards

To be 6-7/10 (budget version):
- Similar strategy but slower
- Weaker win conditions
- Still effective, just less explosive

WINNING THE GAME
=================

Primary Path: Gray Merchant Encore
- Requirements: Devotion 10+, Gray Merchant in GY, Araumi + 3UB available
- Execution: Encore Gary, drain 30+ life total
- Timing: Turn 5-6 on average

Secondary Path: Kokusho Encore
- Requirements: Kokusho in GY, Araumi + 4UB available
- Execution: Encore Kokusho, gain 45 life, drain 15 per opponent
- Timing: Turn 6-7 on average

Tertiary Path: Sacrifice Loops
- Requirements: Altar of Dementia in play, Woe Strider in GY, Araumi available
- Execution: Encore Woe Strider (6 creatures), sacrifice all to Altar, mill 20-30
- Timing: Turn 6-8 depending on setup

Backup Path: Value Grind
- Requirements: Multiple encore turns, recursion creatures
- Execution: Encore Archaeomancer repeatedly, recur spells, overwhelm with value
- Timing: Turn 8-12 in grindy games

The key to winning is FLEXIBILITY. Don't force Gray Merchant if opponents have answers. Encore for value (Mulldrifter), draw into answers, then encore for the win.
