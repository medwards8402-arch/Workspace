// COMMANDER ANALYSIS
// ========================================

GRENZO, DUNGEON WARDEN
Cost: {X}{B}{R}
Type: Legendary Creature — Goblin Rogue
Stats: 2/2 base
Abilities:
  - Enters with X +1/+1 counters
  - {2}: Put bottom card of library into graveyard
         If creature with power ≤ Grenzo's power, put onto battlefield

STRENGTHS:
✓ Cheats creatures into play bypassing mana costs
✓ Activated ability works at instant speed
✓ Very cheap commander (~$0.28)
✓ Unique bottom-of-library mechanic
✓ Scales with X value

WEAKNESSES:
✗ Random element - can whiff on non-creatures
✗ Needs power ≤ Grenzo to work
✗ Library manipulation is limited in Rakdos
✗ No built-in protection

// ========================================
// CORE STRATEGY
// ========================================

GAMEPLAN:
1. EARLY GAME (Turns 1-3)
   - Play mana rocks (Sol Ring, Signets)
   - Cast Grenzo with X=0 or X=1
   - Set up sacrifice outlets (Viscera Seer priority!)

2. MID GAME (Turns 4-7)
   - Activate Grenzo repeatedly ({2} per activation)
   - Use Viscera Seer scry to put bad cards on BOTTOM
   - Build board with ETB creatures
   - Establish death trigger engines

3. LATE GAME (Turns 8+)
   - Drain opponents with Blood Artist/Zulaport/Gary
   - Loop creatures through graveyard
   - Use Reito Lantern to stack bottom of library
   - Overwhelm with creature value

KEY INTERACTIONS:
• Viscera Seer: Sacrifice creature → Scry 1 → Put card on BOTTOM for Grenzo!
• Reito Lantern: Put creature from GY on bottom → Grenzo activates → Creature returns!
• Mortuary Mire/Witch's Cottage: Put creature on top → Scry to bottom → Grenzo!

// ========================================
// MULLIGAN GUIDE
// ========================================

KEEP HANDS WITH:
✓ 2-4 lands (including at least 1 black source)
✓ 1-2 mana rocks OR low-cost creatures
✓ Access to both colors by turn 3
✓ At least one sacrifice outlet OR Grenzo synergy

MULLIGAN HANDS WITH:
✗ 0-1 lands or 6+ lands
✗ No black sources (can't cast Grenzo)
✗ All high-cost cards with no ramp
✗ No synergy pieces

IDEAL OPENING:
Turn 1: Land
Turn 2: Land, Sol Ring or Signet
Turn 3: Land, Grenzo (X=0 or X=1)
Turn 4: Start activating Grenzo

// ========================================
// PRIORITY TARGETS
// ========================================

PROTECT THESE CARDS:
1. Grenzo himself (recast tax adds up!)
2. Viscera Seer (best card in deck)
3. Blood Artist / Zulaport Cutthroat (win conditions)
4. Pitiless Plunderer (enables explosive turns)

SACRIFICE PRIORITY (when you must choose):
Low priority (sac first): Burglar Rat, Reassembling Skeleton
Medium priority: Most ETB creatures (already got value)
High priority (protect): Syr Konrad, Grim Haruspex, Midnight Reaper

// ========================================
// MATCHUP NOTES
// ========================================

VS. GRAVEYARD HATE:
- Don't overextend into graveyard
- Prioritize Reito Lantern (works even with hate)
- Win through creature combat if drain blocked

VS. CREATURE-LIGHT DECKS:
- Blood Artist triggers on ANY creature dying
- Focus on ETB value over sacrifice loops
- Gray Merchant devotion drain is one-sided

VS. BOARD WIPES:
- Death triggers actually benefit you!
- Blood Artist drains for each death
- Reassembling Skeleton always comes back

VS. ARTIFACT HATE:
- Protect Sol Ring and Ashnod's Altar
- Mana rocks are vulnerable - rely on Burnished Hart
- Creature-based ramp like Ornithopter survives some hate

// ========================================
// WIN CONDITIONS
// ========================================

PRIMARY: DEATH TRIGGER DRAIN
- Blood Artist + Zulaport Cutthroat + sacrifice loops
- Each creature death pings all opponents
- Gray Merchant for big life swings

SECONDARY: OVERWHELMING BOARD
- Free creatures from Grenzo activations
- Siege-Gang Commander + Chittering Witch tokens
- Goblin Bombardment as finisher

TERTIARY: INFINITE COMBO (with upgrades)
- Murderous Redcap + persist reset + sac outlet
- Ashnod's Altar + recursion engine
