# Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER - Deck Strategy Guide

## Commander Overview

**Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER** {2}{B}
- 3/3 Legendary Creature — Human Avatar Soldier
- **Front Side Abilities:**
  1. When Sephiroth enters or attacks, you may sacrifice another creature to draw a card
  2. Whenever another creature dies, target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life
  3. Transforms after the 4th death trigger in a turn

**Sephiroth, One-Winged Angel** (Back Side)
- 5/5 Flying
- Super Nova: When transforming, you get an EMBLEM: "Whenever a creature dies, target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life"
- When attacking, sacrifice any number of creatures to draw that many cards

**Key Insight:** The emblem is PERMANENT. Once you transform Sephiroth, the drain effect stays even if Sephiroth dies. This makes transformation a priority.

## Core Strategy

### Primary Game Plan: Aristocrats Drain
1. Build a board of sacrifice fodder and death payoffs
2. Sacrifice creatures to trigger Sephiroth + Blood Artist effects
3. Stack multiple drain triggers for massive life swings
4. Transform Sephiroth to lock in permanent drain emblem

### Win Conditions
- **Death Drain:** Each creature death triggers commander (1 life) + Blood Artist effects (1-2 more) = 3-4 damage per death
- **Gray Merchant:** With heavy black devotion, Gary can drain 10-15+ life from each opponent
- **Exsanguinate/Profane Command:** Direct drain spells scaled to late game mana
- **Transformed Emblem:** Permanent drain makes every future creature death painful

### Transformation Plan
To transform Sephiroth, you need 4 creature deaths in a single turn:
1. Attack with Sephiroth (triggers ability)
2. Sacrifice creatures to free sac outlets (Viscera Seer, Woe Strider)
3. Each death triggers commander ability
4. After 4th trigger, Sephiroth transforms and grants permanent emblem

**Board State Needed:** 4+ creatures, 1+ sac outlet, Sephiroth attacking

## Card Categories Breakdown

### Death Trigger Payoffs (7 cards)
These stack with Sephiroth's built-in drain:
- Blood Artist, Zulaport Cutthroat: Classic drain effects
- Bastion of Remembrance: Enchantment drain (harder to remove)
- Falkenrath Noble, Vindictive Vampire: Creature drain effects
- Syr Konrad: Triggers on death AND graveyard movement
- Butcher of Malakir: Forces opponents to sacrifice

### Sacrifice Outlets (5 cards)
Free sac outlets to control when creatures die:
- Viscera Seer: Scry 1 per sacrifice
- Bloodthrone Vampire, Nantuko Husk: Pump effects
- Yahenni: Indestructible, gets counters
- Woe Strider: Scry + returns as token

### Recurring Creatures (7 cards)
These come back for repeated sacrifices:
- Reassembling Skeleton: 1B to return from graveyard
- Bloodsoaked Champion: Returns when attacking
- Tenacious Dead, Persistent Specimen: Return on death
- Sanitarium Skeleton: Returns with 2B
- Cult Conscript: Attacks, then returns
- Gravecrawler: Returns with Zombie on board (you have several)

### Token Generators (5 cards)
Sacrifice fodder production:
- Ophiomancer: Snake token EACH upkeep (if no snakes)
- Sifter of Skulls: Eldrazi Scion tokens on death
- Endrek Sahr: Thrulls equal to creature CMC
- Open the Graves: Zombie tokens on death
- Dreadhorde Invasion: Army token each upkeep (growing)

## Gameplay Guide

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
**Priority:** Ramp + Set up engine pieces
- Turn 1: Play Sol Ring or Wayfarer's Bauble
- Turn 2: Cast 2-drop ramp (signets) or recurring creature
- Turn 3: Cast Sephiroth OR set up death payoffs

**Key Plays:**
- Deploy recurring creatures early (Reassembling Skeleton)
- Get a sac outlet on board when possible
- Blood Artist effects should come down before mass sacrificing

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)
**Priority:** Build critical mass, aim for transformation
- Attack with Sephiroth to draw cards/trigger drain
- Set up 4+ creatures and a sac outlet
- Time your sacrifice engine for explosive turns

**Transformation Turn:**
1. Have 4+ creatures and a sac outlet
2. Attack with Sephiroth
3. Sacrifice 4 creatures (triggers command ability 4 times)
4. Sephiroth transforms, grants permanent emblem
5. Continue draining with emblem active

### Late Game (Turns 7+)
**Priority:** Close out the game
- Emblem + death payoffs means each creature death drains 3-5 life
- Gray Merchant with high devotion for massive drain
- Exsanguinate for X=10+ in late game
- Mass sacrifice with Woe Strider for card draw

## Vulnerabilities & Counters

### Graveyard Hate
**Problem:** Rest in Peace, Leyline of the Void exile your recursion
**Solution:** 
- Bojuka Bog for opponent graveyards
- Token generators don't rely on graveyard
- Transform Sephiroth early (emblem is permanent)

### Commander Removal
**Problem:** Sephiroth getting killed repeatedly
**Solution:**
- Swiftfoot Boots, Whispersilk Cloak for hexproof/shroud
- Commander costs only 3 mana, tax isn't catastrophic
- Once transformed, emblem persists even if Sephiroth dies

### Board Wipes
**Problem:** Losing all your creatures
**Solution:**
- Low curve means fast recovery
- Board wipes trigger ALL your death effects simultaneously
- Recurring creatures come back after wipe
- If emblem is active, opponent's wipe helps you!

## Combo Highlights

### 4-Death Transformation Combo
- Board: Sephiroth + 4 creatures + Viscera Seer
- Attack with Sephiroth, sacrifice 4 creatures
- 4 death triggers = transform Sephiroth
- Get permanent drain emblem

### Infinite Sacrifice (Budget)
- Reassembling Skeleton + Sifter of Skulls + any sac outlet
- Sacrifice Skeleton, get Eldrazi Scion
- Sacrifice Scion for mana, pay 1B to return Skeleton
- Repeat for infinite death triggers
- Each death drains with Blood Artist effects and emblem

### Gray Merchant Loop
- Gray Merchant + Victimize + 2 creatures
- Gary enters, drains opponents
- Sacrifice Gary + creature to Victimize
- Return Gary + another creature
- Gary enters again, drains again
