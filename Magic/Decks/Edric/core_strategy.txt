UNIQUE/FUN CARDS - Target: 4 cards
===================================
Goal: Memorable cards that aren't "too on the nose"

Requirements:
- Not just card draw (Edric already draws)
- Not single-target pump
- Game-changing effects
- 3-6 CMC sweet spot
- Budget friendly (<$2 each)

Tier 1 - Game-Changing:
1. Triumph of the Hordes (2GG) - $8-12 - TOO EXPENSIVE
   - Would be perfect (mass infect pump) but out of budget
2. Beastmaster Ascension (2G) - $3.00 - Borderline
   - Triggers: +5/+5 to all creatures permanently
   - AMAZING but expensive
3. Craterhoof Behemoth (5GGG) - $12-20 - TOO EXPENSIVE

Tier 2 - Unique Effects:
4. Nacatl War-Pride (3GGG) - $0.25 - Already in mass pump!
5. Biomass Mutation (XG/U G/U) - $0.25 - Already in mass pump!
6. Notorious Throng (3U) - $0.25 - Already in mass pump!

Tier 3 - Tap/Control:
7. Opposition (2UU) - $1.00 - Tap creature: tap permanent
   - AMAZING with tokens/weenies
8. Sleep (2UU) - $0.25 - Tap all opponent's creatures, don't untap
9. Blustersquall (U) - $0.10 - Overload 3U: Tap all opponent's creatures
10. Tidal Wave (2U) - $0.10 - Tap all nonblue creatures

Tier 4 - Protection/Utility:
11. Spellskite (2) - $3.00 - TOO EXPENSIVE
12. Cyclonic Rift (1U) - $3-5 - Overload 6U: Bounce all nonland permanents opponents control
    - AMAZING but borderline expensive
13. Awakening Zone (2G) - $0.50 - Create 0/1 Eldrazi Spawn tokens
    - Blockers + sacrifice for mana

Tier 5 - Win-More Fun:
14. Coat of Arms (5) - $2.00 - TOO EXPENSIVE
15. Bident of Thassa (2UU) - $0.50 - Creatures you control get card draw on damage
    - TOO ON THE NOSE (Edric already does this)
16. Coastal Piracy (2UU) - $0.25 - Draw when creature damages opponent
    - TOO ON THE NOSE

REVISED UNIQUE/FUN (4 cards):
1. Opposition - $1.00 (tap control)
2. Sleep - $0.25 (one-sided tap down)
3. Blustersquall - $0.10 (flexible tap)
4. Awakening Zone - $0.50 (token generation + ramp)

Unique Cards Subtotal: $1.85

Wait, these feel too much like "tempo/control" additions rather than memorable fun cards. Let me reconsider:

BETTER UNIQUE/FUN:
1. Beastmaster Ascension (2G) - $3.00 - Splurge on this, it's worth it
   - Permanent +5/+5 after 7 attacks
   - Game-winning card
2. Awakening Zone (2G) - $0.50 - Token generation
3. Opposition (2UU) - $1.00 - Tap control with weenies
4. Notorious Throng (3U) - Already counted in mass pump!

Actually, Notorious Throng should be unique, not mass pump. Let me reorganize:

FINAL UNIQUE/FUN (4 cards):
1. Beastmaster Ascension - $3.00 (permanent pump)
2. Opposition - $1.00 (tap control)
3. Awakening Zone - $0.50 (token generation)
4. Notorious Throng - $0.25 (extra turn + tokens)

Unique Cards Subtotal: $4.75

And update mass pump to remove Notorious Throng:
Mass Pump: Overrun, Overwhelming Stampede, Echoing Courage, Murmuring Mystic, Biomass Mutation, Nacatl War-Pride, Hunger of the Howlpack
That's 7 cards, good.

CORE STRATEGY SUMMARY
======================
Total Cards: 44 cards
- Evasive creatures: 23 cards - $3.95
- Mass pump: 7 cards - $1.30 (removed Notorious Throng)
- Protection: 5 cards - $2.45
- Unique/fun: 4 cards - $4.75
