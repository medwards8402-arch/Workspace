4. **Awakening Zone** - Slow if board gets wiped
   - Replace with: Kodama's Reach ($0.30) - More reliable ramp

5. **Notorious Throng** - Dead card if no Rogues or can't deal combat damage
   - Replace with: Coastal Piracy ($0.40) - More consistent card draw

## Upgrade Path ($15-25 total investment)

### Tier 1 Upgrades (Best bang for buck)

2. **Beast Whisperer** ($1.50) - Draw engine for creatures
3. **Guardian Project** ($2.00) - Backup Edric effect
4. **Coastal Piracy** ($0.40) - Additional Edric effect
5. **Mystic Remora** ($3.50) - Insane early card draw

### Tier 2 Upgrades (Power boosts)

### Tier 3 Upgrades (Optimization)
11. **Rhystic Study** ($20+) - Best card draw in format (luxury upgrade)
12. **Cyclonic Rift** ($3.50) - Already in main deck, ensure in budget deck
13. **Consecrated Sphinx** ($25+) - Card draw engine (luxury)
14. **Yavimaya Coast** ($1.50) - Pain land, better than guildgate
15. **Hinterland Harbor** ($2.00) - Check land, better than enters tapped lands

## Budget-to-Main Transition
If playing budget deck and want to upgrade to main deck:
1. Add Sol Ring ($1.50) - Best first upgrade
2. Add Beastmaster Ascension ($3.00) - Best win condition
3. Add Cyclonic Rift ($3.50) - Best removal
4. Add Exotic Orchard ($0.75) - Better mana
5. Add Reliquary Tower ($0.50) - No max hand size with Edric

Total upgrade cost: $9.25 to go from budget to main deck

## Cards to Avoid (Traps)
- **Edric ETB doublers** (Panharmonicon) - Don't work with Edric's combat trigger
- **Card draw doublers** (Alhammarret's Archive $8) - Win-more, overkill
- **Wheels** (Windfall, Day's Undoing) - Give opponents cards too
- **Extra combat** (Aggravated Assault) - Better to just win with one combat + pump
- **Expensive creatures** (>3 CMC without evasion) - Too slow, miss Edric triggers

## Meta-Specific Additions

### Casual/Battlecruiser Meta
Add: More expensive finishers, fewer counterspells
- In: Crater's Claws ($0.25), Genesis Wave ($1.00), Rite of Replication ($1.50)
- Out: Counterspell, Negate, some protection

### Competitive/cEDH-Adjacent Meta
Add: Fast mana, more interaction, cheaper creatures
- In: Mana Crypt ($150 - only if very competitive), extra counterspells, Flusterstorm ($15)
- Out: Slower mass pump, 3+ CMC creatures, "fun" cards like Notorious Throng

### Multiplayer Political Meta
Add: Group hug effects, incentivize not attacking you
- In: Rites of Flourishing ($2), Edric himself (draws for opponents too)
- Out: Oppressive cards like Opposition, taxing effects

Total sideboard budget: $3-5 for meta swaps, $15-25 for upgrade path
