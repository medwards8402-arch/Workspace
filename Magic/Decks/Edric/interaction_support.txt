Core Strategy: 44 cards - $12.45
  - Evasive creatures: 23 cards - $3.95

SUBTOTAL: 70 cards - $23.00

MISSING: 30 cards (need 100 total)

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount:

Evasive creatures: 23
Mass pump: 7
Protection: 5
Unique: 4
Removal: 6
Draw: 4
Ramp: 10
Lands: 35
Commander: 1

TOTAL: 23+7+5+4+6+4+10+35+1 = 95 cards

Need 5 more cards!

ADDITIONAL CARDS NEEDED (5 cards):
Looking at gaps...

1. Need more evasive creatures? Have 23, could use 2-3 more
2. Need more interaction? Have 6 removal + 5 protection = 11 total (good)
3. Need more ramp? Have 10 (good for low curve)

Let me add 5 more evasive creatures:

ADDITIONAL EVASIVE CREATURES (5 cards):
1. Daring Apprentice (1UU) - $0.10 - 1/1 flying, {T} sacrifice: counter spell
   - Flying + utility (counterspell)
   
2. Dream Stalker (1U) - $0.10 - 1/5 (no evasion) - SKIP
   
3. Sage's Row Denizen (2U) - $0.10 - 2/3 (no evasion) - SKIP

4. Monastery Flock (2U) - $0.10 - 0/4 flying, defender - SKIP

5. Augury Owl is already in list!

Let me think differently. We need utility creatures with evasion:

Better additions:
1. Man-o'-War (2U) - $0.10 - 2/2, bounce creature
   - No evasion but utility - SKIP

2. Aerie Ouphes (4G) - $0.10 - Flying, sacrifice: destroy flying creature
   - Anti-flying but has flying itself

3. Scryb Ranger (1G) - $0.25 - Flying, return forest: untap creature
   - Flying + untap for extra activations

4. Whirler Rogue (2UU) - $0.10 - 2/2, creates 2 1/1 thopter tokens (flying)
   - Tokens for Edric triggers

5. Skycat Sovereign (WU) - NO WHITE

6. Favorable Winds (1U) - $0.25 - Flying creatures get +1/+1
   - Anthem for flyers

FINAL ADDITIONAL 5 CARDS:
1. Scryb Ranger - $0.25 (flying + untap utility)
2. Whirler Rogue - $0.10 (flying tokens)
3. Aerie Ouphes - $0.10 (flying + removal)
4. Daring Apprentice - $0.10 (flying + counterspell)
5. Favorable Winds - $0.25 (flying anthem)

Additional Cards Subtotal: $0.80

UPDATED TOTALS:
Core Strategy: 44 cards - $12.45
Additional: 5 cards - $0.80
Support: 25 cards - $10.10
Removal: 6 cards - $1.30
Card Draw: 4 cards - $1.35
Ramp: 10 cards - $3.75
Lands: 35 cards - $3.70
Commander: 1 card - $0.40

Wait, I'm double counting. Let me organize properly:

FINAL COUNT:
Commander: 1
Evasive creatures: 23 + 5 additional = 28
Mass pump: 7
Protection: 5
Unique: 4
Removal: 6
Draw: 4
Ramp: 10
Lands: 35

TOTAL: 1+28+7+5+4+6+4+10+35 = 100 cards ✓

FINAL BUDGET:
Commander: $0.40
Evasive creatures (28): $3.95 + $0.80 = $4.75
Mass pump (7): $1.30
Protection (5): $2.45
Unique (4): $4.75 (includes $3 Beastmaster)
Removal (6): $1.30
Draw (4): $1.35
Ramp (10): $3.75
Lands (35): $3.70

TOTAL: $23.75

Wait, this is WAY under budget ($50-60 target). I have ~$26-36 remaining!

I can upgrade several cards:

UPGRADES TO CONSIDER:
1. Add Lightning Greaves ($2.50) instead of one basic land? No, need lands.
2. Upgrade Beastmaster is already in ($3)
3. Add Cyclonic Rift ($3-5)?
4. Add better lands?

Let me add some power cards within budget:

POWER ADDITIONS (5 cards to add value):
1. Cyclonic Rift (1U) - $3.50 - Bounce permanent or overload 6U: bounce all nonland permanents opponents control
   - AMAZING tempo card
   
2. Beast Within is already in

3. Rhystic Study (2U) - $20+ - TOO EXPENSIVE

4. Mystic Remora (U) - $5-8 - Borderline but powerful
   - Let's skip, too expensive

5. Growing Ranks (2G/W G/W) - $0.25 - NO WHITE

6. Bident of Thassa (2UU) - $0.50 - Draw when creatures damage opponents
   - TOO ON THE NOSE (Edric already does this)

Actually, the deck is fine at $23.75. Being under budget is good! It allows for future upgrades.

But I should add Cyclonic Rift since we have budget:

Replace one evasive creature with Cyclonic Rift:
Remove: Aerie Ouphes ($0.10)
Add: Cyclonic Rift ($3.50)

Updated removal section:
REMOVAL (7 cards):
1. Beast Within - $0.50
2. Nature's Claim - $0.10
3. Pongify - $0.25
4. Rapid Hybridization - $0.25
5. Blink of an Eye - $0.10
6. Into the Roil - $0.10
7. Cyclonic Rift - $3.50

New Removal Subtotal: $4.80

Evasive creatures now: 27 (removed Aerie Ouphes)

FINAL TOTALS:
100 cards - $27.15 ✓
