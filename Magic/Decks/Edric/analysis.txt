EDRIC, SPYMASTER OF TREST - DECK BUILDING ANALYSIS
==================================================

PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS GATHERING
================================
Budget Constraints:
- Main Deck: $50-60 (Commander: ~$0.40, remaining cards: $49.60-59.60)
- Budget Deck: $25-30 (Commander: ~$0.40, remaining cards: $24.60-29.60)
- Exactly 100 cards in both versions

Meta Context:
- 4-player 1-hour games
- Fast-paced gameplay favoring explosive wins
- Lower interaction requirement (4-6 removal, not 8-12)
- Focus on finishing, not controlling

Differentiation:
- Must differ from existing decks:
  * Araumi: Encore ETB burst (triple simultaneously)
  * Grenzo: Bottom-deck manipulation + aristocrats
  * Vannifar: Pod chains
  * Xaxara: X-spells and hydra tokens
- Edric focuses on: Flying/unblockable weenies + card draw + mass pump

Power Level: 7-8/10
Colors: Simic (UG)

PHASE 2: COMMANDER ANALYSIS
============================
Edric, Spymaster of Trest - 1GU
Legendary Creature - Elf Rogue
Power/Toughness: 2/2

Ability: "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to one of your opponents, its controller may draw a card."

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
1. Triggers on combat damage to OPPONENTS (not you)
   - Your creatures trigger when they hit opponents
   - Opponents' creatures trigger when they hit other opponents
   - Political tool (opponents get cards for hitting each other)

2. "May" draw (optional)
   - Not forced draw (won't mill yourself out)
   - Can decline if close to decking

3. Works with ANY creature dealing damage
   - Not just evasive creatures
   - But evasive creatures guarantee triggers

4. Each creature draws separately
   - 10 creatures hit = 10 cards drawn
   - Massive card advantage engine

5. Edric himself is 2/2 with no evasion
   - Needs protection (dies easily)
   - Target for removal (opponents hate the card draw)

CORE STRATEGY:
==============
Primary Win Condition:
- Deploy 20-25 cheap evasive creatures (1-2 CMC)
- Edric draws cards equal to creatures that connect
- Draw into mass pump effects (Overrun, Craterhoof, etc.)
- Alpha strike for lethal (pump all creatures, attack for 40+ damage)

Strategy Phases:
1. Early (Turns 1-3): Deploy 1-2 creatures per turn, ramp
2. Mid (Turn 4): Cast Edric, start drawing cards
3. Draw (Turns 5-6): Draw 5-10 cards per turn from Edric triggers
4. Win (Turn 6-7): Cast Overrun effect, alpha strike for lethal

Win Condition Math:
- 15 creatures on board
- Cast Overrun (+3/+3, trample to all creatures)
- Each creature is now 4/4+ with trample/evasion
- 15 × 4 = 60 damage (enough to kill 2 players)
- Turn 6-7 win typical

Secondary Strategy:
- Extra turn spells (Notorious Throng has prowl)
- Tap down opponents' creatures (can't block)
- Counter key removal spells
- Political draw (let opponents draw to not attack you)

VULNERABILITIES:
================
1. Board Wipes:
   - Destroy all creatures including Edric
   - Lose card draw engine
   - IMPACT: High (need to rebuild)
   - MITIGATION: Low curve (rebuild quickly), card advantage (refill hand)

2. Edric Removal:
   - Edric dies → commander tax increases
   - Second cast: 5 mana, third cast: 7 mana
   - IMPACT: Medium (can still win without Edric if have cards)
   - MITIGATION: Protection spells, hexproof equipment, counterspells

3. Flying/Reach Blockers:
   - Block evasive creatures
   - No Edric triggers
   - IMPACT: Medium (some creatures get blocked)
   - MITIGATION: Multiple evasion types (flying, unblockable, shadow), removal

4. Propaganda/Ghostly Prison Effects:
   - Tax attacking
   - Can't afford to attack with all creatures
   - IMPACT: High (shuts down strategy)
   - MITIGATION: Removal (Beast Within, Nature's Claim), bounce (Cyclonic Rift)

5. Stax/Prison Effects:
   - Prevent casting spells or attacking
   - IMPACT: High (slows down strategy significantly)
   - MITIGATION: Fast clock (win before they set up), removal

6. Being Archenemy:
   - Edric draws hate (everyone knows the deck)
   - Opponents prioritize killing Edric
   - IMPACT: Medium-High (need politics)
   - MITIGATION: Politics (give opponents cards), protection, fast wins

SYNERGY IDENTIFICATION:
=======================
Critical Synergies:
1. Evasive creatures + Edric = Card draw
2. Card draw + Mass pump = Win condition
3. Low CMC creatures + card draw = Deploy multiple per turn
4. Extra turns + Edric triggers = More attacks, more draws

Engine Pieces Needed:
- 20-25 evasive creatures (1-3 CMC flying, unblockable, shadow)
- 4-6 protection spells (protect Edric)
- 7-8 mass pump effects (win conditions)
- 3-4 counterspells (protect Edric, stop board wipes)

DECK BUILDING PRIORITIES:
==========================
1. Evasive creatures with power ≥1 (flying, unblockable, shadow)
2. CMC 1-2 preferred (deploy early, multiple per turn)
3. Mass pump effects (Overrun, Craterhoof, Triumph of the Hordes)
4. Protection for Edric (hexproof, counterspells, Lightning Greaves)
5. Low curve (avg 2.0-2.5 CMC) for fast deployment
6. Minimal removal (4-6 cards, fast meta)
7. Card draw redundancy (in case Edric removed)

Avoid:
- Non-evasive creatures (get blocked, no Edric triggers)
- Single-target pump (we want MASS pump for all creatures)
- High CMC cards (slow down deployment)
- Board wipes (kill our creatures)
- Creatures without evasion (exception: utility creatures)

PHASE 3: DECK BUILDING THEORY APPLICATION
==========================================
For Edric Flying Weenies:

Lands: 35-36 (very low curve deck)
Ramp: 8-10 (need less, have card draw engine)
Card Draw: 3-5 (Edric provides most draw)
Removal: 4-6 (fast multiplayer meta)

Strategy Cards (~45):
- Evasive creatures: 20-25 cards (core of deck)
- Mass pump effects: 7-8 cards (win conditions)
- Protection: 4-5 cards (protect Edric)
- Interaction: 4-6 cards (removal, counters)
- Unique/fun: 4 cards

Average CMC: 2.0-2.5 (very aggressive)
Power Level: 7-8/10

PHASE 4: BUDGET RESEARCH
=========================
Expensive Staples to AVOID:
- Craterhoof Behemoth ($12-20) - Too expensive
- Triumph of the Hordes ($8-12) - Too expensive (was cheaper, price spiked)
- Noble Hierarch ($8+) - Too expensive
- Beastmaster Ascension ($3-5) - Borderline, skip
- Birds of Paradise ($3-5) - Borderline
- Cyclonic Rift ($3-5) - Borderline
- Rhystic Study ($20+) - WAY too expensive
- Mystic Remora ($5-8) - Too expensive

Budget Alternatives:
- Overrun ($0.25) instead of Craterhoof
- Overwhelming Stampede ($0.50) instead of Craterhoof  
- Elvish Mystic ($0.10) instead of Birds of Paradise
- Echoing Courage ($0.10) for mass pump
- Beast Within ($0.50) for removal
- Llanowar Elves ($0.10) for ramp

Price Targets:
- Commander: $0.40
- Lands: $5-8 (mostly basics, few UG duals)
- Ramp: $2-4 (creature ramp, cheap artifacts)
- Evasive creatures: $5-10 (bulk 1-2 CMC flyers)
- Mass pump: $3-6 (Overrun effects)
- Protection: $2-4 (Swiftfoot Boots, counterspells)
- Removal: $2-3
- Unique cards: $4-6

Estimated Total: $24-45 (target $50-60)
