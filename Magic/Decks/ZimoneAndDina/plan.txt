ZIMONE AND DINA - DECK PLAN & ANALYSIS
======================================

COMMANDER OVERVIEW
==================
Zimone and Dina {B}{G}{U} - Legendary Creature — Human Dryad (3/4)
- Whenever you draw your second card each turn, target opponent loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.
- {T}, Sacrifice another creature: Draw a card. You may put a land from your hand onto the battlefield tapped. If you control 8+ lands, repeat this process once.

Commander Cost: ~$0.36 (well under $5 limit)

CORE STRATEGY
=============

Primary Win Condition: Life Drain
---------------------------------
The deck aims to trigger Zimone and Dina's drain ability as often as possible:
- Each trigger = 2 life loss to opponent + 2 life gain for you
- In a 4-player game, targeting each opponent once per turn cycle = 6 damage dealt, 6 life gained
- Combined with aristocrats effects (Blood Artist, Zulaport Cutthroat), each sacrifice = additional drain

Secondary Win Condition: Big Mana Finishers
-------------------------------------------
- Exsanguinate (X = each opponent loses X, you gain that much)
- Debt to the Deathless (X = each opponent loses 2X, you gain life equal to total lost)
- Villainous Wealth (steal opponent's deck)

Tertiary: Landfall Beatdown
---------------------------
- Rampaging Baloths (4/4s on landfall)
- Avenger of Zendikar (plant army)
- Tatyova, Benthic Druid (draw + life on landfall)

ENGINE BREAKDOWN
================

Draw Second Card Triggers (12 cards):
-------------------------------------
Cards that help you draw your second card each turn:
1. Brainstorm - Instant draw 3, enables trigger anytime
2. Temple Bell - Tap to draw (each player), can use on opponents' turns
3. Howling Mine - Each player draws extra card on upkeep (triggers on YOUR upkeep)
4. Dictate of Kruphix - Flash, each player draws extra on upkeep
5. Curse of Verbosity - Draw when enchanted player is attacked
6. Horn of Greed - Draw when playing lands (synergy with Zimone's ability!)
7. Phyrexian Arena - Draw on YOUR upkeep (guarantees 2nd card draw)
8. Heartwood Storyteller - Draw when noncreature spells cast
9. Secrets of the Dead - Draw when casting from graveyard
10. Notion Thief - Opponents' draws become YOUR draws (combo with group draw!)
11. Monastery Siege - Either draw/discard or tax opponents
12. Kumena's Awakening - Each player draws on upkeep (Ascend version only you draw)

Key Synergy: Notion Thief + Howling Mine/Dictate = Opponents draw nothing, you draw everything!

Sacrifice Fodder (10 cards):
----------------------------
Cheap or recurring creatures to feed Zimone's tap ability:
1. Reassembling Skeleton - 1B: Return from GY to battlefield
2. Persistent Specimen - 1B: Return from GY to battlefield  
3. Awakening Zone - Makes 0/1 Eldrazi Spawn each upkeep (sac for mana OR Zimone)
4. From Beyond - Makes 1/1 Eldrazi Scion each upkeep
5. Jadar, Ghoulcaller of Nephalia - Makes 2/2 Zombie each end step
6. Tireless Provisioner - Makes Food/Treasure on landfall (sac for Zimone synergy)
7. Blight Mound - Makes 1/1 Pest when nontoken creature dies (chain sacrifices!)
8. Shambling Ghast - Dies: drain 1 OR make Treasure
9. Sanitarium Skeleton - 1B: Return from GY to hand
10. Squirrel Nest - Enchant land: tap for 1/1 Squirrel

VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
======================

1. Commander Removal
   Problem: Deck relies heavily on Zimone and Dina
   Solutions:
   - Swiftfoot Boots / Lightning Greaves for hexproof/shroud
   - Snakeskin Veil for instant protection
   - Aristocrats effects work without commander (Blood Artist, etc.)
   - Big mana finishers (Exsanguinate) don't need commander

2. Graveyard Hate
   Problem: Reassembling Skeleton, Persistent Specimen, Secrets of the Dead rely on GY
   Solutions:
   - Most of the deck doesn't rely on graveyard
   - Token generators (Awakening Zone, etc.) are GY-independent
   - Main strategy is draw triggers, not GY recursion
   - Sideboard has Loaming Shaman for reshuffle

3. Enchantment/Artifact Hate
   Problem: Draw engines (Howling Mine, etc.) are artifacts/enchantments
   Solutions:
   - Deck has 6 removal spells including Nature's Claim, Beast Within
   - Redundancy in draw engines (12 cards)
   - Commander provides card advantage independently

4. Board Wipes
   Problem: Token generators and creatures get swept
   Solutions:
   - Recurring creatures (Reassembling Skeleton, Sanitarium Skeleton)
   - Enchantment-based token generators survive creature wipes
   - Low CMC curve allows quick rebuilding
   - Aristocrats trigger on death (benefit from wipes!)

MANA CURVE ANALYSIS
===================

CMC 1: ~8 cards (Brainstorm, cantrips, cheap creatures)

CMC 4: ~10 cards (win conditions, payoffs)
CMC 5: ~6 cards (Avenger, finishers)
CMC 6+: ~4 cards (big finishers)

Average CMC: ~3.0 (healthy for midrange strategy)

GAMEPLAY GUIDE
==============

Early Game (Turns 1-3):
-----------------------
- Prioritize ramp: Sol Ring, signets, land ramp
- Play draw engines when possible (Howling Mine, Dictate)
- Set up token generators (Awakening Zone)

Mid Game (Turns 4-6):
---------------------
- Cast Zimone and Dina
- Start sacrificing tokens for draw + land drops
- Trigger drain ability each turn
- Deploy aristocrats effects

Late Game (Turns 7+):
---------------------
- Should have 8+ lands for doubled Zimone ability
- Massive Exsanguinate or Debt to the Deathless
- Villainous Wealth for blowout plays
- Avenger of Zendikar for token army

COMBO HIGHLIGHTS
================

1. Notion Thief + Howling Mine/Dictate of Kruphix
   - Opponents' card draws are replaced with your draws
   - Each opponent's upkeep, you draw instead of them
   - Locks opponents out of resources while you draw 4+ cards/turn

2. Zimone + 8 Lands + Recurring Creature
   - Sacrifice, draw 2, put 2 lands into play
   - Each activation = 2 Zimone triggers = 4 life drain
   - With Reassembling Skeleton, can activate multiple times per turn

3. Blood Artist + Awakening Zone + Sac Outlet
   - Each Eldrazi Spawn sacrifice = drain 1 (Blood Artist)
   - Feeds Zimone for draw + land + 2 life drain
   - Self-sustaining engine
