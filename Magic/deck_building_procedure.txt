EDH DECK BUILDING PROCEDURE
======================================
Version 2.0 - Updated with Zimone and Dina lessons learned

This document outlines a systematic procedure for building budget EDH/Commander decks
optimized for 1-hour 4-player multiplayer games. Focus is on finishing games, not
controlling the board. Single-target removal is de-emphasized in favor of win conditions.

======================================
PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS GATHERING
======================================

1. Collect User Constraints:
   □ Budget: Default $60 target, strict $75 maximum (no need to ask)
   □ Commander choice or preferences
   □ Playgroup meta: DEFAULT is 1-hour 4-player multiplayer
      - Fast games = fewer removal, more win conditions
      - Avoid cards that lengthen games (excessive control, stax)
   □ Deck preferences (tricky, aggro, control, combo, etc.)
   □ Existing commanders (avoid duplicates)
   □ Friends' commanders (avoid duplicates)
   □ Desired deck characteristics (replayability, politics, etc.)

2. Document Format Requirements:
   □ Check existing decks for formatting standards
   □ Note category structure (Lands, Ramp, Card Draw, etc.)
   □ Understand output format (TappedOut compatible)
   □ Confirm sideboard requirements (alternatives vs upgrades)

3. Set Hard Limits:
   □ EXACTLY 100 cards (99 + Commander)
   □ Commander price: <$5 preferred
   □ Deck cost: $60 target, $75 strict maximum
   □ Sideboard approach (budget alternatives for testing, not upgrades)
   □ Single deck output (no main + budget split)
   □ Prioritize win conditions over interaction for 1-hour games

======================================
PHASE 2: COMMANDER ANALYSIS
======================================

1. Research Commander Mechanics:
   □ Read exact card text and abilities
   □ Identify power/toughness requirements (e.g., Grenzo's power threshold)
   □ Note activation costs and restrictions
   □ Understand timing windows (instant speed, sorcery speed, etc.)
   □ Check for summoning sickness implications

2. Identify Core Strategy:
   □ What is the PRIMARY win condition?
   □ What is the SECONDARY strategy?
   □ What cards are CRITICAL to the strategy?
   □ What synergies exist?
   □ What are the combos or engines?

3. Identify Vulnerabilities:
   □ What shuts down the strategy? (graveyard hate, enchantments, etc.)
   □ Commander removal/tax problem?
   □ Board wipe recovery?
   □ Does the deck have backup plans?
   □ What common hate pieces exist in the meta?

======================================
PHASE 3: DECK BUILDING THEORY
======================================

Standard EDH Deck Composition Template:
□ 35-38 Lands (adjust based on curve and strategy)
   - Higher CMC decks (avg 3.5-4.5): 37-38 lands
   - Lower CMC decks (avg 2.5-3.5): 35-36 lands
   - Commanders with built-in card advantage: fewer lands needed
□ 8-12 Ramp sources
   - High CMC strategies: 10-12 ramp
   - Low CMC strategies: 8-10 ramp
□ 7-10 Card draw effects
   - Colors with weak draw (WR, RG): 10+ sources
   - Colors with strong draw (UGx): 7-8 sources
□ 4-6 Removal (DEFAULT for 1-hour 4-player games)
   - Prioritize versatile removal (any permanent) over creature-only
   - Single-target creature removal is low-value in multiplayer
   - Board wipes only if one-sided or very cheap (Blasphemous Act)
   - Focus on answering must-kill threats, not controlling board
   - Long grindy games (if needed): 8-10 removal
□ Remaining slots for strategy (~30-45 cards)

Strategy-Specific Categories:
□ Engine pieces (critical to strategy, 8-15 cards)
□ Synergy creatures/spells (15-25 cards)
□ Win conditions (finishers, drain effects, pump spells, 3-5 cards)
□ Protection/Enablers (haste, protection spells, sac outlets, 3-8 cards)
□ Utility (answers to specific threats, 2-5 cards)

Color-Specific Considerations:
□ White: Efficient removal, board wipes, weak ramp (artifact ramp)
□ Blue: Strong draw, counterspells, weak removal (bounce/counter)
□ Black: Strong draw/removal, tutors, weak enchantment removal
□ Red: Direct damage, artifact removal, weak card draw (impulse draw)
□ Green: Best ramp, creature removal, weak board wipes
□ Multi-color: More fixing needed, access to more answers

======================================
PHASE 4: BUDGET RESEARCH
======================================

1. Identify Expensive Staples to AVOID:
   □ Research common cards in the archetype
   □ Check prices on TCGPlayer/CardKingdom (VERIFY ACTUAL PRICES!)
   □ Create "DO NOT INCLUDE" list with prices
   □ Document why they're too expensive
   □ Common pricing mistakes:
      - Assume old prices without checking current market
      - Assume bulk rares are cheap (many are $3-8)
      - Assume common/uncommon means cheap (format staples can be $1-5)

2. Find Budget Alternatives:
   □ Search for common/uncommon replacements
   □ Prioritize bulk cards (<$0.15)
   □ Accept slightly higher cost ONLY for CRITICAL pieces ($0.50-1.00 max)
   □ Total cards >$0.50 should be <10 cards in entire deck
   □ NO card over $2 unless absolutely essential to strategy

3. Price Categories (for ~$60 budget):
   □ Commander: <$3 (ideally <$1)
   □ Lands: $2-8
      - Mono/2-color: $2-4 (mostly basics + gates)
      - 3+ colors: $5-8 (budget duals, NO lands over $0.50)
   □ Ramp: $4-8
      - Green decks: $4-6 (land ramp is cheap)
      - Non-green: $6-8 (artifact ramp)
   □ Card Draw: $3-7
   □ Removal: $2-5 (less removal needed for 1-hour games)
   □ Strategy pieces: $15-25 (STRICT - verify each card!)
   □ Win conditions: $4-8 (prioritize these, but stay cheap)
   □ Utility/Protection: $3-8

======================================
PHASE 5: CORE STRATEGY BUILD
======================================

1. Build Engine Package (8-15 cards):
   □ Identify the 3-5 CRITICAL cards that enable the strategy
   □ Add redundancy (2-4 backup cards that do similar things)
   □ Add tutors or manipulation if budget allows
   □ Examples:
      - Aristocrats: Sac outlets + blood artist effects
      - Spellslinger: Cost reduction + copy effects
      - Tokens: Token doublers + anthem effects
      - Voltron: Equipment/auras + protection
      - Reanimator: Discard outlets + reanimation spells

2. Add Synergy Pieces (15-25 cards):
   □ Creatures/spells that work with commander
   □ CMC should match strategy:
      - Aggro/tempo: Focus on 1-3 CMC
      - Midrange: Focus on 2-4 CMC
      - Control/combo: Mix of all CMCs
      - Ramp/big mana: 4-6+ CMC payoffs
   □ Ensure synergies match commander's strategy
   □ Examples:
      - Token decks: Token generators + go-wide payoffs
      - +1/+1 counters: Counter generators + proliferate
      - Graveyard: Self-mill + recursion targets

3. Include Win Conditions (3-5 cards):
   □ How does the deck actually KILL opponents?
   □ Common win condition types:
      - Combat damage: Overrun effects, evasion, pump spells
      - Drain/burn: Blood Artist effects, Impact Tremors, Purphoros
      - Mill: Persistent Petitioners, Bruvac, Altar of Dementia
      - Combo: Infinite loops, game-winning synergies
      - Alternative wins: Laboratory Maniac, Approach of the Second Sun
   □ Don't assume value = wins (common mistake)
   □ Include multiple paths to victory
   □ CRITICAL: Ensure win conditions match strategy
      - Mass pump for go-wide strategies (Overrun, not single-target pumps)
      - Evasive infect needs unblockable/flying infect creatures
      - Commander synergy matters (Edric needs evasive creatures for draw)

4. Add Protection/Enablers (3-8 cards, varies by strategy):
   □ Haste enablers (if commander/creatures have tap abilities or need immediate impact)
   □ Sacrifice outlets (aristocrats, creature protection, ETB abuse)
   □ Untap effects (if commander has tap abilities)
   □ Protection spells (hexproof, indestructible for key pieces)
   □ Cost reduction (for spell-heavy or expensive decks)
   □ Examples by strategy:
      - Tap-ability commanders: Haste (Lightning Greaves, etc.)
      - Aristocrats: Sac outlets (Viscera Seer, Ashnod's Altar)
      - Spellslinger: Cost reduction (Goblin Electromancer)
      - Voltron: Protection (Swiftfoot Boots, Heroic Intervention)

5. Include Unique/Fun Cards (4 cards):
   □ Cards that add personality and memorability to the deck
   □ Should loosely fit the strategy but don't need to be optimal
   □ Often come from commander precons or older niche cards
   □ Should be somewhat powerful or synergistic with commander
   □ Budget friendly (<$2 each typically)
   □ CRITICAL: Don't be "too on the nose" with commander
      - Avoid cards that just repeat what commander already does
      - Look for unexpected angles or game-changing effects
      - Example: For Edric (draw from combat damage), avoid more "draw from combat" cards
      - Instead: Biomass Mutation (turn everything into X/X), Notorious Throng (extra turns)
   □ Consider mana cost vs deck curve
      - High CMC unique cards (7+) don't work in low-curve aggro decks
      - X spells scale well with any curve
      - 4-6 CMC sweet spot for most decks
   □ Examples by strategy:
      - Rakdos decks: Threaten effects (steal/sac), Insurrection, Torrent of Souls
      - Simic evasive: Biomass Mutation, Nacatl War-Pride, Notorious Throng
      - Token decks: Warp World, Genesis Wave, Thieves' Auction
      - Artifacts: Unwinding Clock, Prototype Portal, Mirrorworks
   □ Don't force references or gimmicks (let them arise naturally)
   □ Avoid cards that only work in specific scenarios or need other combo pieces

======================================
PHASE 6: INTERACTION PACKAGE
======================================

NOTE: For 1-hour 4-player games (the default meta), minimize interaction.
Every turn spent answering threats is a turn not spent winning.

1. Removal Suite (4-6 cards for 1-hour games):
   □ Versatile removal (any permanent): 3-4 cards - PRIORITY
   □ Single-target creature removal: 1-2 cards only
   □ Avoid narrow answers (creature-only, artifact-only)
   □ Prioritize: Beast Within, Chaos Warp, Generous Gift, Assassin's Trophy
   □ Examples by color:
      - White: Generous Gift, Swords to Plowshares
      - Blue: Counterspell (protects your win), Reality Shift
      - Black: Feed the Swarm, Deadly Rollick
      - Red: Chaos Warp, Abrade
      - Green: Beast Within, Nature's Claim, Krosan Grip

2. Board Wipes (0-1 cards for 1-hour games):
   □ Board wipes LENGTHEN games - use sparingly
   □ Only include if one-sided (Plague Wind, Crux of Fate for dragons)
   □ Or very cheap/efficient (Blasphemous Act at 1 mana)
   □ Avoid: 5+ mana symmetrical wipes that reset the game
   □ Ask: "Does this help me win or just delay everyone?"

3. Graveyard Interaction:
   □ If strategy uses graveyard, include protection
   □ Include graveyard hate for opponents
   □ Example: Bojuka Bog for opponent's graveyards

======================================
PHASE 7: SUPPORT PACKAGE
======================================

1. Card Draw (7-10 cards):
   □ Essential in colors that struggle (red, white, black)
   □ Mix of one-shot and repeatable effects
   □ Match draw to strategy:
      - Creature decks: Creature-based draw (Elemental Bond, Garruk's Uprising)
      - Spell decks: Cantrips, card selection (Ponder, Brainstorm)
      - Graveyard decks: Looting effects (Faithless Looting)
      - Go-wide decks: Draw per creature (Shamanic Revelation)
   □ Budget options by color:
      - Blue: Ponder, Brainstorm, Fact or Fiction
      - Black: Night's Whisper, Sign in Blood, Read the Bones
      - Green: Harmonize, Rishkar's Expertise, Soul's Majesty
      - Red: Faithless Looting, Thrill of Possibility, Light Up the Stage
      - White: Mentor of the Meek, Dawn of Hope, Esper Sentinel

2. Ramp (8-12 cards):
   □ Green decks: Land ramp preferred (Rampant Growth, Cultivate, Kodama's Reach)
   □ Non-green: Artifact ramp (Sol Ring, signets, diamonds, Mind Stone, Fellwar Stone)
   □ 2 CMC ramp preferred for consistency
   □ High CMC decks: Include 10-12 ramp sources
   □ Low CMC decks: 8-10 ramp sources sufficient
   □ 3+ color decks: Prioritize color-fixing ramp (signets, Commander's Sphere)
   □ Budget artifact ramp: Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, signets, diamonds, Mind Stone, Fellwar Stone

3. Lands (35-38 cards):
   □ Calculate color requirements and distribution:
      - Mono-color: 35-36 basics + 1-2 utility lands
      - 2-color: 14-16 of each basic + 5-7 duals
      - 3-color: 10-12 of each basic + 7-10 duals
      - 4-5 color: 8-10 of each + 10-15 fixing lands
   □ Budget dual lands: Gates, bounce lands (Karoos), gain lands, Terramorphic Expanse
   □ Utility lands (2-4): Bojuka Bog, cycling lands, Reliquary Tower, Rogue's Passage
   □ Higher CMC decks: 37-38 lands
   □ Lower CMC decks: 35-36 lands
   □ Avoid expensive lands: Fetchlands, shocklands, ABUR duals (unless within budget)

======================================
PHASE 8: VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
======================================

Critical Questions to Ask:
□ What happens if commander gets removed 3+ times?
   - Include backup recursion or alternative win conditions
   - Examples: Cost reduction (for recasting), recursion (reanimate), alternative threats

□ What if graveyard gets exiled?
   - Include alternative recursion paths
   - Don't rely solely on graveyard

□ What if key enchantment/artifact shuts down strategy?
   - Include versatile removal in all colors
   - Examples: Chaos Warp (R), Beast Within (G), Generous Gift (W), Cyclonic Rift (U), Feed the Swarm (B)

□ What if board gets wiped?
   - Include recovery mechanisms
   - Card draw, recursion, low CMC curve

□ How does deck win if primary strategy fails?
   - Include 2-3 backup win conditions
   - Examples: Combat damage (as backup to combo), drain effects (as backup to tokens), commander damage (as backup plan)

======================================
PHASE 9: DECK ASSEMBLY & VALIDATION
======================================

1. Count Cards by Category:
   □ Create category structure matching existing decks
   □ Verify EXACTLY 100 cards (99 + Commander)
   □ Double-check math: sum all categories

2. Validate Color Identity (CRITICAL - DO THIS BEFORE FINALIZING):
   □ List commander's colors explicitly (e.g., "Sultai = B, G, U")
   □ For EVERY card, check ALL mana symbols (casting cost AND text box)
   □ Common mistakes to catch:
      - X spells with off-color mana (Debt to the Deathless is WUBB, not just XBB)
      - Hybrid mana counts as BOTH colors
      - Activated abilities with colored mana in cost
      - Reminder text in parentheses doesn't count (extort is fine)
   □ Use Scryfall search: "id:[colors]" to verify (e.g., "id:sultai Exsanguinate")
   □ If in doubt, check the card on Scryfall - color identity is displayed

3. Validate Strategy Ratios (for 1-hour 4-player games):
   □ 8-15 engine pieces?
   □ 15-25 synergy pieces?
   □ 5-8 win conditions? (MORE for fast games!)
   □ 4-6 removal? (LESS for fast games!)
   □ 7-10 card draw?
   □ 10-12 ramp?
   □ 4 unique/fun cards?

3. Check Mana Curve:
   □ Average CMC varies by strategy:
      - Aggro/tempo: 2.0-3.0 average
      - Midrange: 2.5-3.5 average
      - Control: 3.0-4.0 average
      - Ramp/big mana: 3.5-5.0 average
   □ CMC distribution should match strategy:
      - Aggro: Heavy at 1-3 CMC, few cards above 4
      - Midrange: Peak at 2-4 CMC, some 5-6 CMC threats
      - Control: Spread across 2-5 CMC, board wipes at 4-5
      - Ramp: Cheap ramp at 2-3, payoffs at 6-8+

4. Budget Validation (CRITICAL - VERIFY EVERY PRICE!):
   □ Calculate total cost by category
   □ Ensure ≤$60 target (strict $75 maximum)
   □ Document ALL cards >$0.50 (there should be <10)
   □ Verify no single card >$2 (unless absolutely essential)
   □ Aim for 90%+ of cards <$0.35 each
   □ VERIFY prices on TCGPlayer (don't assume!)
   □ If over budget: cut expensive cards FIRST, replace with bulk
   □ Check sideboard budget too (~$3-5 total)
   □ RECOUNT total after any substitutions

======================================
PHASE 10: DOCUMENTATION
======================================

1. Create Deck File ([CommanderName].txt):
   □ Use TappedOut format (copy/paste ready)
   □ Start with deck title comment: "# [Commander Name] (~$XX)"
   □ First line: "1x [Commander Name] *CMDR*"
   □ Blank line after commander
   □ Organize by categories with "# Category Name (count)" (e.g., "# Lands (36)")
   □ List all cards as "1x Card Name" (no prices in main list)
   □ Categories should be: Lands, Ramp, Card Draw, Removal, [Strategy-specific sections]
   □ End with blank line + comments for strategy summary
   □ Comments use # prefix: "# Strategy: [brief description]"
   
   Example format:
   # Commander Name (~$55)
   
   1x Commander Name *CMDR*
   
   # Lands (36)
   10x Island
   8x Swamp
   1x Command Tower
   ...
   
   # Ramp (10)
   1x Sol Ring
   1x Arcane Signet
   ...
   
   # Strategy: [One-line summary]
   # Primary Win: [Win condition]
   # Turn X-Y average win, Power Level X/10

2. Create Sideboard File (sideboard.txt):
   □ Standard prose format (not TappedOut format - reference document)
   □ 15-18 budget alternative cards (<$0.50 each preferred)
   □ NOT expensive upgrades (keep budget philosophy)
   □ Include alternative creatures, removal, tech cards
   □ Total sideboard cost: ~$3-5 (must be buyable with deck)
   □ Purpose: Testing and tuning, meta adjustments
   □ Organize by: Situational cards, Flexible slots, Meta-specific swaps

3. Create Plan File (plan.txt):
   □ Comprehensive strategy guide
   □ Commander overview and mechanics
   □ Core strategy breakdown
   □ Engine and synergy explanations
   □ Vulnerability analysis
   □ Gameplay guide (early/mid/late game)
   □ Combo highlights
   □ Budget breakdown by category
   □ Final checklist verification

NOTE: Only the deck file uses TappedOut format.
Sideboard and plan files are reference documents in prose format.

======================================
PHASE 11: CRITICAL GAP ANALYSIS
======================================

Review Deck for Missing Pieces:
□ Win conditions sufficient?
□ Answers to enchantments/artifacts?
□ Graveyard protection/alternatives?
□ Commander tax mitigation?
□ Board wipe recovery?
□ Haste enablers (if needed)?
□ Sacrifice outlets (if needed)?
□ Backup recursion paths?

Check for Combo Pieces Without Payoffs:
□ Review each card for typical combo uses
□ Common orphaned combo pieces:
   - Curiosity/Ophidian Eye without ping effects (Niv-Mizzet, etc.)
   - Cloud of Faeries without bounce land abuse or Aluren
   - Sigil Tracer without other Wizards to tap
   - Thieving Skydiver in low-curve decks (can't pay high X)
   - Blink effects (Jeskai Barricade) without ETB creatures
   - Mana doublers without high-cost payoffs
   - Creature type matters cards without critical mass of that type
□ Replace orphaned combo pieces with cards that work standalone
□ If keeping combo pieces, include their enablers or payoffs

Meta-Specific Adjustments:
□ 1-hour 4-player games: Reduce single-target removal, increase win conditions
   - 4-6 removal instead of 8-12
   - Focus on finishing games, not controlling board
   - Versatile removal (hits any permanent) > creature removal
□ Long grindy games: More card advantage, more removal
□ Competitive meta: More interaction, faster combos
□ Casual meta: More fun cards, less efficient tutors

Add Missing Pieces (maintain 100 card limit):
□ Identify lowest-impact cards
□ Replace with critical missing pieces
□ Re-validate card count
□ Update plan document

======================================
PHASE 12: FINAL REVIEW CHECKLIST
======================================

Deck Completeness:
□ Exactly 100 cards (99 + Commander)
□ All categories represented
□ Win conditions present (3-5)
□ Interaction sufficient (10 removal)
□ Card draw adequate (7-10)
□ Ramp present (10)
□ Mana base functional (37 lands)

Budget Compliance:
□ Total cost ≤ user's budget
□ Commander ≤ $5 (or user's limit)
□ Documented cost breakdown
□ No individual card breaks budget

Strategy Coherence:
□ Engine pieces present (8-12)
□ Synergy creatures/spells (15-20)
□ Win conditions identified
□ Backup plans exist
□ Vulnerabilities addressed

Documentation Complete:
□ Deck file created (TappedOut format)
□ Sideboard file created (budget alternatives)
□ Plan file created (comprehensive guide)
□ All files in correct directory

User Requirements Met:
□ Matches user preferences
□ Avoids duplicate commanders
□ Appropriate for playgroup meta
□ Replayability/trickiness as requested

======================================
COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
======================================

1. Budget Creep:
   ❌ "This card is only $3, it's worth it"
   ✅ Stick to bulk cards, splurge on 3-4 critical pieces max

2. Value Without Wins:
   ❌ Deck generates tons of value but no way to close games
   ✅ Include 3-5 explicit win conditions

3. Narrow Answers:
   ❌ Only creature removal, no enchantment/artifact answers
   ✅ Include versatile removal (Chaos Warp, etc.)

4. Commander Over-reliance:
   ❌ Entire strategy requires commander surviving
   ✅ Include backup plans and alternative win conditions

5. Ignoring Summoning Sickness:
   ❌ Tap-ability commanders with no haste
   ✅ Include 2-3 haste enablers

6. Graveyard Vulnerability:
   ❌ All recursion relies on graveyard
   ✅ Include alternative paths (token copies, direct reanimation)

7. Tribal Over-focus:
   ❌ "Goblin tribal" as PRIMARY strategy without payoffs
   ✅ Use creature types as SECONDARY theme, focus on abilities

8. Card Count Errors:
   ❌ Forgetting to count commander, ending up with 101 cards
   ✅ Always verify: 99 cards + 1 commander = 100 total

9. Insufficient Testing Categories:
   ❌ No mana curve analysis
   ✅ Check average CMC, ensure low curve

10. Sideboard as Upgrades:
    ❌ $50 sideboard with expensive cards "to buy later"
    ✅ $2-5 sideboard with budget alternatives for tuning

11. Mismatched Win Conditions:
    ❌ Single-target pump spells in go-wide deck
    ❌ Non-evasive infect creatures in evasive deck
    ✅ Mass pump (Overrun) for go-wide strategies
    ✅ Win conditions that synergize with commander

12. Not Verifying Card Prices:
    ❌ Assuming bulk rares are cheap without checking
    ❌ Using outdated price information
    ✅ Verify every card >$0.50 on current market
    ✅ Budget can explode quickly ($65 becomes $150)

13. Missing Unique/Fun Cards:
    ❌ All cards are "optimal" but deck lacks personality
    ❌ Forcing gimmick cards that don't work
    ❌ Unique cards are "too on the nose" (just repeat commander's effect)
    ✅ Include 4 unique cards that loosely fit strategy
    ✅ Focus on memorability and commander synergy
    ✅ Budget-friendly unique cards (<$2 each)
    ✅ Look for unexpected angles, not direct synergy

14. Combo Pieces Without Payoffs:
    ❌ Including Curiosity without ping effects
    ❌ Cloud of Faeries without bounce land combos
    ❌ Blink effects without ETB creatures
    ❌ Sigil Tracer as the only Wizard
    ✅ Check each card for typical combo uses
    ✅ Either include the combo or remove the orphaned piece
    ✅ Prioritize cards that work standalone

15. Too Much Single-Target Removal for Meta:
    ❌ 10+ removal spells in 1-hour 4-player games
    ❌ Spending turns answering threats instead of winning
    ✅ 4-6 removal for fast multiplayer games
    ✅ Prioritize versatile removal (any permanent) over creature-only
    ✅ More win conditions, less interaction

16. Including Cards That Don't Support Core Strategy:
    ❌ Vodalian Zombie (vanilla 2/1 with weak draw) in encore deck
    ❌ Siren Stormtamer (1/1 single-use counter) vs permanent protection
    ❌ Slip Out the Back (single protection) when repeatable mill more valuable
    ❌ Havengul Lich (cast from GY) when strategy wants creatures IN graveyard
    ❌ In Garruk's Wake (9 mana) when deck wins on turn 5-6
    ✅ Every card should actively support the strategy
    ✅ Ask: "Does this help me win?" not "Is this value?"
    ✅ ETB creatures in encore deck need STRONG triggers (draw multiple, removal, drain)
    ✅ Replace weak synergy with strong synergy at same budget

17. Color Identity Violations:
    ❌ Grisly Salvage (BG) in Dimir (UB) deck
    ❌ Forgetting hybrid mana costs add both colors
    ❌ Not checking color indicators on flip cards
    ✅ Verify every card matches commander's color identity
    ✅ Check mana symbols in cost, text box, AND color indicator
    ✅ Commander format: Color identity is strict (no exceptions)

18. Budget Creep (MOST COMMON ISSUE):
    ❌ "Just $1 more" on 20+ cards = $20+ over budget
    ❌ Assuming staples are cheap (Sol Ring, Arcane Signet can be $1-3)
    ❌ Not verifying prices during card selection
    ❌ Including $2-5 cards without checking alternatives
    ❌ Lands creeping up (Command Tower, Exotic Orchard, etc.)
    ✅ CHECK PRICE of every non-basic BEFORE adding to deck
    ✅ If card is >$0.50, search for cheaper alternative FIRST
    ✅ Hard rule: <10 cards over $0.50 in entire deck
    ✅ Hard rule: NO cards over $2 unless essential
    ✅ Verify total cost after EVERY 10-15 cards added
    ✅ If over $60, immediately cut most expensive non-essential cards

19. Wrong Deck File Format (CRITICAL):
    ❌ Using "1 Card Name // $0.50 - description" format
    ❌ Using "// Comment" style comments instead of "# Comment"
    ❌ Putting prices inline with card names
    ❌ Adding card descriptions/notes inline
    ❌ Forgetting *CMDR* tag on commander
    ❌ Forgetting "1x" prefix on card names
    ✅ ALWAYS check existing deck file format BEFORE creating new deck
    ✅ Format MUST be TappedOut-compatible for copy/paste
    ✅ Use "1x Card Name" format (no prices, no descriptions)
    ✅ Use "# Section Name (count)" for categories
    ✅ Use "# Comment text" for notes (at end of file only)
    ✅ Commander line: "1x Commander Name *CMDR*"
    ✅ Price only in title: "# Commander Name (~$XX)"

20. Including Expensive "Staple" Cards Without Checking Price:
    ❌ Assuming format staples are cheap (many are $5-$50+!)
    ❌ Not verifying prices on cards commonly mentioned in guides
    ❌ Including cards from memory without current price check
    
    KNOWN EXPENSIVE "STAPLES" TO AVOID (prices fluctuate):
    - Phyrexian Altar (~$50+)
    - Ashnod's Altar (~$6-12)
    - Altar of Dementia (~$10+)
    - Imperial Recruiter (~$10+)
    - Pitiless Plunderer (~$2-3)
    - Phyrexian Arena (~$3+)
    - Grave Pact (~$4+)
    - Dictate of Erebos (~$2+)
    - Urza's Incubator (~$15+)
    - Herald's Horn (~$5+)
    - Coat of Arms (~$5+)
    
    ✅ VERIFY PRICE ON SCRYFALL for EVERY card before including
    ✅ Search with "usd<0.5" filter to find budget alternatives
    ✅ If Scryfall shows price >$2, DO NOT include - find alternative
    ✅ Never trust card name recognition - always verify

======================================
TEMPLATE: QUICK START CHECKLIST
======================================

When creating a new deck, go through this checklist:

SETUP:
□ Get user requirements (budget, commander, meta, preferences)
□ Assume 1-hour 4-player multiplayer unless specified otherwise
□ Research commander mechanics and strategy
□ Identify expensive cards to avoid
□ Create deck folder: Magic/Decks/[CommanderName]/

CORE BUILD (Single Deck - $60 target, $75 max):
□ Define primary strategy and win conditions
□ Build engine package (8-12 cards)
□ Add synergy creatures (15-20 cards)
□ Include win conditions (5-8 cards - prioritize finishing games)
□ Add protection/enablers (3-5 cards)
□ Include unique/fun cards (4 cards, not too on-the-nose)
□ Check for orphaned combo pieces (remove or add payoffs)

SUPPORT BUILD:
□ Add removal (4-6 versatile pieces, prioritize exile/flexibility)
□ Add card draw (7-10 cards)
□ Add ramp (10 cards)
□ Add lands (36-37 cards)
□ Board wipes: 0-1 max (avoid game-lengthening cards)

VALIDATION:
□ Count cards = exactly 100
□ **COLOR IDENTITY CHECK**: Verify EVERY card's mana symbols match commander
   - Check casting costs AND text boxes for off-color mana
   - Common traps: X spells with hidden colors (Debt to the Deathless = WUBB)
□ Check deck budget ≤ $60 (hard cap $75) - VERIFY every card >$0.50
□ Verify 5-8 win conditions present
□ Check 4-6 removal pieces (versatile preferred)
□ No stax or excessive control (finish games, don't drag them out)
□ Check for vulnerabilities
□ Add missing pieces

DOCUMENTATION:
□ **READ EXISTING DECK FILE FIRST** for format reference
□ Create [CommanderName].txt (TappedOut format - see example below)
□ Create sideboard.txt (15-18 budget alternatives for testing)
□ Create plan.txt (strategy guide and breakdown)

TAPPEDOUT FORMAT REMINDER:
   # Commander Name (~$XX)
   
   1x Commander Name *CMDR*
   
   # Lands (36)
   10x Basic Land
   1x Nonbasic Land
   
   # Ramp (10)
   1x Sol Ring
   
   # [Category] (count)
   1x Card Name
   
   # Strategy: [summary at end]

======================================
EXAMPLE: EDRIC LESSONS LEARNED
======================================

What Went Right:
✅ 25 evasive creatures for consistent Edric triggers
✅ Multiple overrun effects (7 win conditions)
✅ Low curve (avg 2.0-2.5 CMC) for fast deployment
✅ 6 protection spells to keep Edric alive
✅ Mass pump instead of single-target (Overrun > Giant Growth)

What Needed Iteration:
⚠ Initial budget estimate was $40-50, actual was $130-150!
⚠ Many "bulk" cards were actually $3-8 (Beastmaster Ascension, Triumph of the Hordes, Intruder Alarm)
⚠ First win conditions didn't match strategy (single-target pumps for go-wide deck)
⚠ Infect creatures without evasion don't work with Edric
⚠ Sideboard started expensive, had to rebuild with <$0.25 cards

Critical Fixes Made:
1. Verified all card prices on current market (removed $50+ in expensive cards)
2. Replaced single-target pumps with mass overruns
3. Removed non-evasive infect creatures (don't trigger Edric or connect)
4. Added 3 more protection spells (Edric dies frequently)
5. Rebuilt sideboard to be truly budget ($2-5 total)

Key Takeaways:
- VERIFY card prices before finalizing deck (biggest lesson!)
- Match win conditions to strategy (mass pump for go-wide)
- Commander synergy is critical (Edric needs evasive creatures)
- Protection is essential for commander-dependent decks
- Sideboard must be budget too (for simultaneous purchase)
- "Bulk rare" doesn't mean cheap in current market

======================================
EXAMPLE: EDRIC V2 LESSONS LEARNED
======================================

What Went Right:
✅ 25 evasive creatures for consistent Edric triggers
✅ 11 win conditions (mass pump effects) for fast multiplayer games
✅ Low curve (avg 2.0-2.5 CMC) for fast deployment
✅ 4 protection spells (focused, not excessive)
✅ Only 4 removal spells (appropriate for 1-hour 4-player games)
✅ 4 unique/fun cards that aren't "too on the nose"
✅ No orphaned combo pieces (removed Curiosity, Cloud of Faeries, Sigil Tracer, etc.)

What Needed Iteration:
⚠ Initial build had 8 removal + 6 protection = 14 reactive cards (too much for fast multiplayer)
⚠ Unique cards were too on-the-nose (Coastal Piracy, Tandem Lookout just repeat Edric's effect)
⚠ Included combo pieces without payoffs (Curiosity, Cloud of Faeries, Sigil Tracer)
⚠ Some cards didn't fit low curve (Rite of Replication, Stolen Identity too expensive)

Critical Changes Made:
1. Reduced removal from 8 to 4 (enough for key threats)
2. Reduced protection from 6 to 4 (focused counterspells + hexproof)
3. Increased win conditions from 5 to 11 (prioritize finishing games)
4. Replaced orphaned combo pieces with standalone evasive creatures
5. Upgraded unique cards to game-changing effects (Biomass Mutation, Nacatl War-Pride, Notorious Throng, Murmuring Mystic)
6. Moved "on the nose" cards to support categories (Coastal Piracy, Tandem Lookout to Card Draw Payoffs)

Key Takeaways:
- 1-hour 4-player games need fewer reactive cards, more win conditions
- Unique cards should be game-changing, not just synergistic
- Check every card for orphaned combo pieces (Curiosity needs Niv-Mizzet, Cloud of Faeries needs Aluren, etc.)
- "On the nose" means repeating what commander already does (avoid this)
- Meta constraints matter more than general theory (4 removal is fine for fast games)
- Consider mana cost when choosing unique cards (7+ CMC doesn't work in 2.5 avg CMC deck)

======================================
EXAMPLE: GRENZO V2 LESSONS LEARNED
======================================

What Went Right:
✅ Price verification from the start (avoided Edric V1 mistake)
✅ Strong bottom-deck manipulation package (8 cards)
✅ Multiple stacking win conditions (6 aristocrats effects)
✅ Budget compliance (~$26-33 final cost)
✅ Meta-specific optimization (no board wipes for lunch games)
✅ Haste enablers for immediate Grenzo activation
✅ Unique/fun cards that actually win games (Insurrection, Torrent of Souls)

What Needed Iteration:
⚠ Initial build had board wipes (wrong for lunch meta)
⚠ First unique cards were underpowered (Kazuul, Wand of Orcus)
⚠ Needed one more card after adjustments

Critical Additions Made:
1. Replaced board wipes with fast win conditions (Purphoros, Warstorm Surge)
2. Upgraded unique cards to powerful synergistic effects (Threaten, Insurrection, Torrent of Souls)
3. Added Fleshbag Marauder for repeatable removal
4. Ensured all creatures had power ≤2 for Grenzo synergy

Key Takeaways:
- Meta requirements override general theory (lunch games = no board wipes)
- Unique cards should be powerful AND memorable (not just cute)
- Stacking win conditions create fast clock (6 aristocrats effects = 4-6 damage per activation)
- Price verification prevents budget explosions
- Commander synergy is critical (all creatures power ≤2, haste enablers essential)
- Theft effects in Rakdos = steal, sac, profit (perfect synergy)

======================================
EXAMPLE: ARAUMI LESSONS LEARNED
======================================

What Went Right:
✅ Self-mill engine (12 cards) feeds graveyard for encore
✅ ETB creatures with strong triggers (draw, removal, drain)
✅ Gray Merchant win condition (3 copies = ~30 life drain)
✅ Instant-speed self-mill for flexibility
✅ Multiple protection pieces (boots, hexproof)
✅ TappedOut format from Phase 10 for easy deck list sharing

What Needed Iteration:
⚠ Initial deck was $170 vs target $65 (didn't verify prices early)
⚠ Card count errors (97, then 96, then 97 cards across iterations)
⚠ Included Grisly Salvage (BG) in Dimir (UB) deck (color identity violation)
⚠ Weak cards that don't support strategy:
   - Vodalian Zombie (vanilla 2/1, weak draw ETB)
   - Siren Stormtamer (1/1 single-use protection)
   - Supernatural Stamina (niche protection that doesn't fit)
   - Havengul Lich (casts from GY, but strategy wants creatures IN GY for encore)
   - Drown in Dreams (mills opponents, not yourself)
   - In Garruk's Wake (9 mana boardwipe in turn 5-6 win deck)
⚠ Slip Out the Back as protection (single-use, repeatable mill more valuable)

Critical Fixes Made:
1. Verified all prices on Card Kingdom (caught $100+ discrepancy)
2. Removed expensive cards, replaced with bulk alternatives
3. Fixed card counts to exactly 100 (systematic recount)
4. Validated color identity (removed Grisly Salvage, replaced with Taigam's Scheming)
5. Replaced weak cards with strategy-supporting cards:
   - Vodalian Zombie → Pilgrim's Eye (ramps, better ETB)
   - Drown in Dreams → Millikin (self-mills + ramps)
   - Siren Stormtamer/Supernatural Stamina → Diabolic Edict/Doom Blade (reliable removal)
   - Havengul Lich → Treasure Mage (tutors artifacts, useful ETB when encored)
   - In Garruk's Wake → Oblivion Stone (5 mana vs 9 mana boardwipe)
   - Slip Out the Back → Perpetual Timepiece (repeatable self-mill)

Key Takeaways:
- Card Kingdom prices differ from TCGPlayer (VERIFY pricing source!)
- Commander color identity is strict (check every mana symbol)
- Card count validation critical (count multiple times, double-check math)
- Every card should actively support strategy (ask: "Does this help encore win?")
- ETB creatures need STRONG triggers (Pilgrim's Eye > Vodalian Zombie)
- Repeatable effects > single-use (Perpetual Timepiece > Slip Out the Back)
- Strategy coherence: Don't include cards that work against strategy
  - Encore wants creatures IN graveyard (not cast from GY like Havengul Lich)
  - Self-mill deck wants mill SELF (not opponents like Drown in Dreams)
- Boardwipe CMC should match deck speed (5 mana for fast deck, not 9)
- TappedOut format essential for deck list sharing and validation
- Board wipes 0-1 max (avoid game-lengthening cards in 1-hour meta)

======================================
END OF PROCEDURE
======================================

This procedure should be followed for all future deck builds to ensure:
- Budget compliance
- Strategic coherence
- Vulnerability coverage
- Complete documentation
- User satisfaction
- Meta-appropriate interaction levels
- No orphaned combo pieces
- Memorable unique cards that aren't "too on the nose"
